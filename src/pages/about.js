                <h3>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer based in NYC.</h3>
                <p>I come from a creative background, including writing, editing, painting (as a hobby), and now web development!</p>
                <p>I first became interested in code while working with developers at previous jobs. I was fascinated by the creative aspect of such technical work.</p>
                <p>So, I went to Flatiron School and completed the Software Engineering Immersive program.</p>
                <p> I love building dynamic user interfaces with well-structured backends. My tech stack includes: 
                    JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
